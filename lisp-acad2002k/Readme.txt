***** DocBar - AutoCAD image-based dockable document selector *****

DocBar works on AutoCAD 2000 and higher versions.

To install:

1) APPLOAD CxDocBar.arx and type DOCBAR at the command line.

CxDocBar will register itself with AutoCAD.  After the initial appload you need only type DOCBAR to load and run the application.

DocBar will dock on all four sides of the AutoCAD window.  When you size the bar below a certain size it will automatically go into a tab mode, similar to the layout tabs.

Happy drafting :)
